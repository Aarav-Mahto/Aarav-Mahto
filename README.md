## 🌟 My Journey as a Developer

My journey as a developer started in **October 2023**, when I built my first blogging website, **IndianCareHub.com**—a platform designed to provide contact details for businesses across India. I developed it using **Spring Boot**, ensuring scalability and dynamic content generation.  

To drive traffic to my website, I dedicated the next **2–3 months** to learning and implementing **SEO strategies, website speed optimization, Core Web Vitals, link building, domain authority (DA) & page authority (PA) improvement, and social media growth**. After continuous optimization, the website gained good traction, and **Google AdSense was approved just 15 days after applying**.  

However, the niche was **not as profitable** as I had hoped, so instead of discontinuing **IndianCareHub.com**, I decided to **expand its reach globally**. Around **April–May 2024**, I **cloned and rebranded** it as **EnquiryList.com**, targeting worldwide business contacts. This version had a **redesigned UI**, additional data, and improved optimization while IndianCareHub.com continued serving Indian businesses.  

Next, I ventured into a different kind of project—a **storytelling platform** where users could read and explore **cartoon, historical, and fictional stories**. I built this website with a **completely unique and interactive UI**, supporting multiple languages. To handle diverse character encodings, I configured both **MySQL and the Spring Boot backend with UTF-8**. This project was hosted on **Morallines.com**, but I later repurposed the domain for a WordPress website.  

As I continued developing more projects, I needed reliable hosting. I initially **experimented with AWS Free Tier**, but after just a month, I received an unexpected bill of around **₹800**, so I switched to **MochaHost**, where I hosted all my websites on a **private JVM**.  

Over time, I built multiple websites and gained hands-on experience in **full-stack development, SEO, hosting management, and performance optimization**. However, as of now, **none of my websites are live, and I do not plan to host any in the future** (Except for some WordPress websites that I handed over to my friends). My focus has shifted towards **building scalable applications and contributing to impactful projects**.
